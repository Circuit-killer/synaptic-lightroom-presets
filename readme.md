# SYNAPTIC LIGHTROOM PRESETS 0.7

This is a collection of presets for Adobe Lightroom 4+ that I regularly use in my post-processing workflow. In the spirit of the open source software movement I am sharing them freely. Enjoy!

## INSTALLATION

Download these presets and copy them to your Lightroom 4+ presets folder. If you don't know where it is, try this help file:
http://helpx.adobe.com/lightroom/kb/preference-file-locations-lightroom-4.html

If you are upgrading I **strongly** recommend deleting the entire `Synaptic Presets` folder and reinstalling rather that overwriting files. I regularly rename or delete existing presets and folders as I work.

If you plan to modify my presets for your own usage but wish to remain updated I would suggest forking this project and learning the ins and outs of GitHub.

## USAGE & ORGANIZATION

I recently divided my develop presets into several different folders:

* General: lens correction and noise reduction.
* Series 1: treatments from 2011 and earlier.
* Series 2: treatments from 2012.
* Series 3: treatments from 2013 to the present day.
* Vignetting: exactly as it says on the tin.

All presets in the main series folders do not affect lens correction, noise reduction, or vignetting, all of which should be applied seperately. The purpose of this is explained below.

Some additional notes:

* Presets with `(A)` refer to autotone; you may wish to adjust toning in the basic panel to achieve a different look.
* Presets with `(W)` alter white balance, often to achieve a desired effect.

Instead of purely descriptive names many of my presets are named after the places I have been. I find this system useful as a mnemonic.

### WORKFLOW

Here is an outline of my workflow:

* Import photos into date-based folders while applying develop and metadata presets.
    * The develop preset I apply by default is "Lens Correction Plus", which combines lens correction with light noise reduction and vignetting. This preset is available in the "general" folder.
    * A metadata preset is not included here but it is easy to make your own and apply it when importing new photos. I set the basics *e.g.* copyright status, contact information, etc.) so I don't need to think about it later.
* Browse through all newly imported photos to quickly pick (P) or reject (R). Skip to the next photo when uncertain. Then filter by flagged and unflagged. (This feature is available in the bottom right of the develop module just above the filmstrip.) The purpose of this step is to focus on the photos worth working on.
* Pick a representative photo and try out different treatments to settle on a base for further manipulation. Apply this treatment to the rest of the photos being processed.
* Work through the photos one by one to make individual modifications. If the same modification is being made on many photos this usually indicates a preset should be updated or created.
* Apply noise reduction and vignetting presets, often in bulk. This can be done before or after working with treatments.
* Add essential metadata to all finalized photos:
    * Filter by flagged photos only.
    * Add location data using the map module.
    * Add a title using the library module.
* Export all finalized photos.
    * Full-size copies for Flickr and archival purposes.
    * 1920 px per side copies for Facebook, blogging, and mobile use.
* Clean up workspace by deleting rejected photos from disk.
