# ASLR PRESETS 0.2

This is a collection of presets for Adobe Lightroom 4+ that I regularly use in my post-processing workflow. I have included my old presets for Adobe Lightroom 3 but no longer support them.

## INSTALLATION

Download these presets and copy them to your Lightroom presets folder. If you don't know where that is, try this help file:

## USAGE

I recently divided my presets into effects, vignetting, and lens correction. Presets from different groups do not overwrite any settings from the others; you can safely play with effects and later apply vignetting and lens correction (or vice versa). Previously I used the lens correction feature for vignetting. Now all vignetting is done properly with post-crop vignetting effects.

This is my system of classifying presets:

* ASLR-A: autotoning presets; fire and forget.
* ASLR-B: presets that include modifications to the basic processing to achieve a particular effect. May require further tweaking.
* ASLR-E: experimental presets; use with caution.
* ASLR-V: vignetting presets.
* ASLR-Z: a few handy shortcuts for lenses I own.

Instead of purely descriptive names many of my presets are named after the place where I first developed them. This is a handy mnemonic to have once you start playing around with them.
