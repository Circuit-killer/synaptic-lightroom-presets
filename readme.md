# SYNAPTIC LIGHTROOM PRESETS 0.11

This is a collection of presets for Adobe Lightroom that I regularly use in my post-processing workflow.

## INSTALLATION

Download these presets and copy them to your Lightroom presets folder. If you don't know where that is, try this help file:

## USAGE

The names should be descriptive enough to give you an idea of what sort of effect is produced by each preset. I use these as starting points for further modification. Some of the time those modifications become presets in a series. There is a mix of auto-toned presets, presets with blue luminance significantly lowered (for deeper skies), and more extreme effects (generally denoted with an "x").
