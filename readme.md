# SYNAPTIC LIGHTROOM PRESETS 0.31

This is a collection of presets for Adobe Lightroom 4+ that I regularly use in my post-processing workflow. In the spirit of the open source software movement I am sharing them freely. Enjoy!

## INSTALLATION

Download these presets and copy them to your Lightroom 4+ presets folder. If you don't know where it is, try this help file:

If you are upgrading I would recommend deleting the entire Synaptic Presets folder and reinstalling rather that overwriting files. I sometimes delete or rename existing presets.

## USAGE

I recently divided my presets into treatments, effects (e.g. vignetting), and lens correction. Presets from different groups do not overwrite any settings from the others; you can safely play with effects and later apply treatments and lens correction (or vice versa). Previously I used the lens correction feature for vignetting. Now all vignetting is done properly with post-crop effects.

This is my system of classifying presets:

* ASLR-A: autotoning presets; fire and forget.
* ASLR-B: presets that include modifications to the basic processing to achieve a particular effect. May require further tweaking.
* ASLR-L: a few handy shortcuts for lenses I own.
* ASLR-N: night presets, generally with more noise reduction.
* ASLR-V: vignetting presets.
* ASLR-X: experimental presets; use with caution.

Instead of purely descriptive names many of my presets are named after the places where I first developed them. This is a handy mnemonic to have once you start playing around with them.

Here is an example workflow:

* Import photos and switch to the Develop pane.
* Select all photos in the filmstrip and apply a few presets to start:
    * Auto tone.
    * A lens correction preset.
    * An effects preset for vignetting e.g. "Soft Shadow 1".
* Run through all imported photos to quickly pick (P) and reject (R).
* Switch to "flagged" view and only view picks and unflagged photos.
* Begin working on individual photos by applying a preset and making further modifications as needed.
